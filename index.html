            <h1>Coronavirus disease<br>COVID-19</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Transmission
            of the virus occurs primarily through the respiratory droplets of infected people.
            Anyone can get infected with COVID-19, especially people over age 60 and those
            with existing medical conditions who are more susceptible of getting seriously ill
            due to lower immunity. These conditions include high blood pressure, diabetes,
            immunosuppression including HIV, cancer and pregnant individuals. Unvaccinated people
            also have a higher risk of severe symptoms.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Asymptomatic individuals 
            may not experience any symptoms at all, but could still be a carrier. On the other
            hand, symptomatic individuals can show symptoms 5–6 days after exposure and last
            between 1–14 days. Symptomatic individuals may experience the following symptoms</p>
            <h3><b>Most common symptoms:</b> </h3>
            <p>1. Fever<br>2. Chills<br>3. Sore throat </p>
            <h3><b>Less common symptoms:</b> </h3>
            <p>1. Muscle aches and heavy arms or legs<br>2. Severe fatigue of tiredness<br>3. Runny or blocked nose <br>4. Headache
            <br>5. Dizziness <br>6. New and persistent cough<br>7. Tight chest or chest pain<br>8. Shortness of breath<br>
            9.appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea<br> 10. loss or change of sense of taste or smell </p>
            <h3><b>Seek immediate medical assistance if you have these symptoms:</b> </h3>
            <p>1. Difficulty breathing, especially at rest, or unable to speak in sentences<br>
                2. Drowsiness or loss of consciousness<br>
                3. Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
                4. Skin being cold or clammy, or turning pale or a bluish colour
                5. Loss of speech or movement.</p>
            <p>People with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment should receive immediate medical attention. 
                The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), 
                and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a
                 severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection. </p>
            <p>Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, experience persistent symptoms.
                 These long-term effects are called long COVID (or post COVID-19 condition). The most common symptoms associated with
                  long COVID include fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>What should I do if I have COVID-19? </h2>
            <p>1. Persons with mild ARI symptoms should test themselves with an ART test
                kit and should stay at home until symptoms resolve. <br>
               2.Avoid close contact with others especially medically vulnerable 
               persons and wear a mask at all times. </p>
            <p>If you have a need to go out while symptomatic, please exercise social responsibility to avoid infecting others – wear a mask, minimise your 
                social interactions and avoid crowded places, do not visit vulnerable settings such as hospitals and nursing homes, and avoid contact with 
                vulnerable persons, such as the elderly. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Prevention </h2>
            <p> Vaccination remains our first line of defence against COVID-19. You can read more about the importance of vaccinations here. </p>
            <h3>To prevent the spread of COVID-19: </h3>
            <p>1. Avoid crowds and keep a safe distance from others, even if they don't  appear to be sick;<br>
            2. Wear a properly fitted mask if you feel sick, have been close to people who are sick, if you are at high-risk, or in crowded or poorly ventilated areas;<br>
            3. Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze;<br>
            4. If you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover.</p>
