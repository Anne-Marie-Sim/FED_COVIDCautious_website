Pandemic Pursuit is a website designed and implemented by Natalie Wong and Anne Marie Sim as a way to educate users on COVID-19.
The website aims to provide an informative and engaging method towards Singaporeans of all ages to learn about COVID19. It provides a wide range of information about the virius, from providing news all around the world related to the virus, to information about the virus. Our website also has an api of google maps with the total number of deaths or number of recorded cases in the world so as to allow users to be updated about the virus.
It has a home page to give users an  Understaning of what covid is as well as a description of symptoms so that they can practice vigilance and learn to spot symptoms in themselves as well as others and take precautions to take against Covid so that they may be influenced to take the correct steps to adequately protect themselves. 
For our gamification element, we have added a Pac-Man style game using JavaScript where the user has to move away from the “infectious” viruses and collect vaccines to win the game. This game teaches users that they can protect themselves and others around them from viruses such as COVID-19 by taking vaccines so that they may do so. 
We imported images and created a layout that functions as a map for the character sprite to make around and programmed it to be interactive with obstacles.
For our newsroom page, it includes news articles related to Covid-19 as well as current and updated statistics on COVID in Singapore. 
The vaccination page contains information on why vaccination is important and essential as well as what type of vaccine is suitable for them to take. It also provides Singaporeans about the different types of vaccines available, as well as the locations at which it can be taken at.
