FED Assignment 2 done by Anne Marie and Natalie

Pandemic Pursuit is a website designed and implemented by Natalie Wong and Anne Marie Sim as a way to educate users on COVID-19  

The website aims to provide a fun and engaging method for users to learn about COVID-19  

 The website has a home page to give users a understanding of what covid is as well as a description of symptoms so that they can practice vigilance and learn to spot symptoms in themselves as well as others and take precautions against Covid. This is so that they may be influenced to take the correct steps to adequately protect themselves. 

For our gamification element, we have added a Pac-Man style game using JavaScript where the user has to move away from the “infectious” viruses and collect vaccines to win the game. This game teaches users that they can protect themselves and others around them from viruses such as COVID-19 by taking vaccines so that they may do so. 

We imported images and created a layout that functions as a map for the character sprite to move around and programmed it to be interactive with obstacles by avoiding them. There are also "viruses" that chase the sprite around the map.

For our newsroom page, it includes news articles related to Covid-19 as well as current and updated statistics on COVID in Singapore. There is also a graph embedded from the Ministry of Health to show COVID-19 statistics of the number of cases bi-weekly in Singapore. 

The vaccination page contains information on why vaccination is important and essential as well as what type of vaccine is suitable for them to take. It also includes a button that bring users to a page where they can identify their nearest vaccination location to get vaccinated.
