          <h1>Coronavirus (COVID-19)<br>Vaccination</h1>
          <hr>
          <h2>Why is it important to get vaccinated?</h2>
          <p>COVID-19 vaccination protects you against severe disease, minimises the
            risk of transmission, and protects our healthcare system 
           from being overwhelmed. Vaccination is free under the National 
           Vaccination Programme for all.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What are the available vaccinations in Singapore?</h2>
          <p>1. Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty <br>
            2. Moderna/Spikevax
            3. Sinovac-CoronaVac</p>
          <p>Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have attained full registration successfully.
            The inclusion of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine in the National </p>
          <p>Vaccination Programme (NVP)* will persist until September 30, 2024. If there are
             no applications for full registration of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine by that date, 
             its inclusion in the NVP will cease. However, the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine will
              remain accessible at private clinics approved for its usage through the Special Access Route (SAR).</p>
          <p>The Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine is presently not available under the NVP due to the discontinuation of
             the original Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine by the manufacturer. Novavax is currently in the process of
              seeking regulatory approval for its updated COVID-19 XBB.1.5 vaccine formulation.</p>
          <p>*Within the National Vaccination Programme, vaccination is provided free of charge to all Singaporean 
            Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long Term Pass Holders, and certain Short Term Pass holders.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What should I do to be vaccinated  against COVID-19?</h2>
          <h3><b>Persons who are 6 months to 4 years should complete the primary series of vaccination with: </b></h3>
          <p>1. Two doses of Moderna/Spikevax, given eight weeks apart, OR<br>
            2. Three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, given eight weeks apart
            </p>
          <p>Persons who are aged 5 years and above should adhere to the following vaccination recommendations:</p>
          <h3><b>For minimum protection: </b></h3>
          <p>1. Three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna/Spikevax or Novavax/Nuvaxovid. The first and
            second doses should be spaced eight weeks apart, while the recommended interval between the second and third doses is five months<br>
            
            2. Four doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac. The first and second doses should be spaced eight weeks apart. Thereafter, the recommended interval 
            between the second and third, as well as third and fourth doses is three months. These would be doses that were previously referred to as the 
            primary vaccination series and the first additional dose.</p>
          <h3><b>For additional protection: </b></h3>
          <p>An additional dose of the updated vaccine at 1 year after the last dose is recommended in the following persons. They can start to receive
            it from five months after their last dose.
           </p>
           <p>1. All persons aged 60 years and above;<br>
            2. Medically vulnerable persons; and <br>
            Residents of aged care facilities</p>
            <p>Encouragement is given for individuals aged 6 months and older to receive an additional dose of the updated vaccine,
              especially targeting healthcare workers, along with household members and caregivers of medically vulnerable individuals. The
              Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna/Spikevax vaccines are suggested for this purpose. Individuals medically ineligible for mRNA vaccines
              may opt for Novavax/Nuvaxovid* or Sinovac-CoronaVac as alternatives.</p>
            <h2>Where can I get vaccinated in Singapore?</h2>
            <p>Individuals eligible for COVID-19 vaccination have the option to visit any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre (JTVC) or polyclinic without prior
              appointment. Alternatively, appointments can be made at a JTVC or Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) via the provided link.</p>
